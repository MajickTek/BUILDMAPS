USAGE
===
to use either of these scripts, you must edit and configure them for your game (Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, a mod, etc).

Then you run them like this:
./build_[os] <path_to_vmf>

Keep in mind that you will need a VMF of some kind to actally build. You can try to use BSPSource (https://github.com/ata4/bspsrc/releases) to decompile a map.
Then you can try to recompile it using these scripts.

Also keep in mind that the linux script has not been tested. Edit it to wherever your Steam directory is on your system.
